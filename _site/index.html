  <h1>Title Blah Blah Text will be whitish Blah</h1>
  <p>intro who Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh... You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords. Sweet, maybe... Passionate, I suppose... But don't ever mistake that for nice. There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky. What? What?! WHAT?! </p>
  <p>News (if any, or blank) Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm the Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I'm wearing a vegetable! You need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up 'genocide'. You'll find a little picture of me there, and the caption'll read 'Over my dead body'. </p>
